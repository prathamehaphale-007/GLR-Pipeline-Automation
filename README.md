# GLR-Pipeline-Automation
GLR Automation: Vision Edition is a Streamlit app that automates insurance reporting. It extracts data from PDF photo reports, uses Groq's Llama 3.3 LLM to interpret key details (insured info, dates, narratives), and intelligently populates a DOCX template, saving hours of manual data entry.
